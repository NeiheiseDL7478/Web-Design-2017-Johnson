<u>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</u> by <u>J.K. Rowling</u> is divided into two parts where Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry and his friends drop out of the school to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes of Voldemort. As they search the horcruxes, they come to know more about the Professor Snape who always <i><b>disliked</i></b> Harry from the beginning of the novel and the past of Mr.Dumbledore. As the world would have seen as on July 15, 2011, the book/movie concludes with Harry discovering himself as one of the horcruxes and so surrenders himself to Voldemort who cast a <i><b>Killing</i></b> curse on Harry. But soon Dumbledore explains that the Horcrux inside Harry has been destroyed when Voldemort used Harry's blood to regain his full strength. Finally towards the end, Harry returns and defeats Voldemort and his supporters with the help of his friends (Ron and Hermione) along with the members of the Order of the Phoenix, his teachers and students thus saving the world of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <!-- Print a paragraph that is a description of a book, include the title of the book as well as its author.

            In the 1960s audio programming was introduced where passengers wore headphones consisting of hollow tubes piping in music. These were installed in some Delta aircraft. Some early wide-bodied aircraft, including the Lockheed L-1011, Boeing 767-200, and 767-300 fleet, had movies projected on to the cabin bulkhead. Also during the late 1980s and early 1990s, CRT monitors over the aisles were added to the 757 fleet, making them the first narrowbody aircraft to feature video entertainment. The MD-90 introduced Delta's first IFE system with LCD monitors in 1995, and the 777 introduced Delta's first in-seat video system in 1999, initially using the Rockwell Collins Total Entertainment System. Delta's first all-digital IFE system with AVOD (Panasonic eFX) was first introduced in 2003 on Delta's former low-cost subsidiary, Song. The Rockwell Collins IFE system on the 777s was replaced by the Panasonic eFX system in 2007, followed by the Panasonic eX2 in 2011. The Panasonic eFX and eX2 systems are trademarked by Delta as Delta on Demand.
