<u>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</u> by <u>J.K. Rowling</u> is divided into two parts where Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry and his friends drop out of the school to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes of Voldemort. As they search the horcruxes, they come to know more about the Professor Snape who always <i><b>disliked</i></b> Harry from the beginning of the novel and the past of Mr.Dumbledore. As the world would have seen as on July 15, 2011, the book/movie concludes with Harry discovering himself as one of the horcruxes and so surrenders himself to Voldemort who cast a <i><b>Killing</i></b> curse on Harry. But soon Dumbledore explains that the Horcrux inside Harry has been destroyed when Voldemort used Harry's blood to regain his full strength. Finally towards the end, Harry returns and defeats Voldemort and his supporters with the help of his friends (Ron and Hermione) along with the members of the Order of the Phoenix, his teachers and students thus saving the world of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <!-- Print a paragraph that is a description of a book, include the title of the book as well as its author.
