            <p class="center">I am a very avid bowler and look to be on the Bowling team here at Divine Child High School. I have been bowling for 10 years nad enjoy it both competitavely and as a leisurely passtime. My highest game ever is a 204 with lots of room for improvement in the sport. Goal wise, the best game to shoot is a 300, meaning that one gets all 12 strikes in the game.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> My goal in life is to be a very good bowler, I have bowled since I was 5, and have since excelled to be the team captain for the Divine Child High School Bowling Team. From when I was 5 years of age to around when I was in Seventh Grade (11-12 years of age). I was very successful with three turkeys, and a four-bagger in my time there. I then went on to bowl for CYO for my Seventh and Eighth grade year (12-13), and then had to move on to High School where I was on thee JV team last year.</p>

            <p class="center">Since I was five years of age, I have bowled in a multitude of different leagues. I have been on a house league at Super Bowl Lanes in Canton, Michigan since I was five up until I was 11. From the ages of 11 to 13, I bowled with Our Lady of Good Council's school bowling team until my 8th grade year. After 8th grade, I have been bowling for Divine Child on both the Bowling Club and Bowling Team, which is a winter sport. Bowling runs in my family. Everyone from my grandparents to my cousins do it as a sport and I am the most active of anyone as of right now with the sport.</p><p>Currently, I carry a 140 average and seek to improve that in order to get on the Varsity Bowling team in the next school year. I anticipate to buy a new bowling ball in order to help me achieve that goal. The one I currently have has served me well and I look to continue to use it. </p>
            <p>I also enjoy watching footbal and baseball on television. It is enjoyable to me to play it with friends. Though I do not have time for this sometimes, it is a good thing to do.</p>

            <p class="center">I am a very avid model builder, on the right-hand side are the things that I have build and want to build, and in the airline color I want to build them. I have built two airplane models this far and have a third on the way. The models have become better bit by bit in terms of presentation and detail in paint and decals. Each model thereafter becomes better and much more enjoyble to look at on display. I have build a model C-47, and an F-14 so far. I have three snap-fit models: a F-18, a 1/200 scale Delta Air Lines Boeing 747-400, and a 1/200 Delta Air Lines Boeing 777-200LR. In addition to the plane modeling, I also spot, and see planes as my house is right by Detroit Metropolitan/ Wayne County Airport (DTW). I am actively looking for the Delta Airlines Boeing 747-400s when I may be out and about, even at relatives' houses. I am espiecially excited when I see Delta Air Lines' 747-400 in the skies over my school and house. I also am exicted that Southwest Airlines is bringing Detroit better airplanes since they reitred 31 Boeing 737-300 airplanes and sent their replacements the Boeing 737 MAX 8 into service. I have yet to fly on any of the planes that Southwest flies that are not Boeing 737-300 or -500. Seeing better planes from southwest in Detroit will be amazing.</p>

                    <p class="center">I like to plane spot (watch planes fly by) in my freetime when I have some. I live right by the airport in Detroit and enjoy seeing planes fly by. When not doing anything wiht planes, I enjoy working with my dad in the yard (or working by myself at a nearby neighbor's house). Though not a common occurence, I enjoy going sohpping ot upgrade my current wardrobe and replace things that do not fit me any more. I also enjoy debating or talking about politics with people when I get the chance to. It helpes me become a better speaker and debater for some issues that I do not condone or support. In my free time, I also have an onoging website that I work on.</p>

I take lots of honors and AP classes in high school because I just do not earn it, I work hard to achieve that status and pride myself of my school work. I would like to into the Technology field when I grow up. Either being a web designer, coder, or otherwise. I also enjoy robotics, but have a hard time fitting it into my life because of all the jobs and tasks that I need to perform. I enjoy learning concepts of History, Math, and Science. My parents are both engineers (mechanical and environmental). Though I think that technology is important to execute those platforms and accordignly to demand, I wish to go into the techonlogy field. I am the first person in my famuly to be taking as many advanced clases at the moment. My work ethic is unlike any other, I work hard and move on. Accuracy is also important to me. I put forth my best effort in all that I do and graciously accept many rewards.</p>
