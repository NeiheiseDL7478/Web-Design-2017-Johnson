        <p>Delta Air Lines began as a crop dusting operation called Huff Daland Dusters, Incorporated. The company was founded on May 30, 1924 in Macon, Georgia, and moved to Monroe, Louisiana, in 1925. They flew a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, designed to combat the boll weevil infestation of cotton crops. Collett E. Woolman, one of the original directors, purchased the company on September 13, 1928, and renamed it Delta Air Service. Service began on June 17, 1929 with the inaugural flight between Dallas, Texas and Jackson, Mississippi.[29]
Delta moved its headquarters to its current location in Atlanta in 1941, and continued to grow through the addition of routes and the acquisition of other airlines. They replaced propeller planes with jets in the 1960s and entered international competition to Europe in the 1970s and across the Pacific in the 1980s.
            Delta's more recent history is marked by its emergence from bankruptcy on April 25, 2007, and the subsequent merger with Northwest Airlines. The merger was announced April 14, 2008, and was set to create the world's largest airline. After approval of the merger on October 29, 2008, Northwest continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta until December 31, 2009 when both carriers' operating certificates were merged (the Delta certificate was kept).[30] Delta completed the integration with Northwest on January 31, 2010 when their reservation systems and websites were combined, and the Northwest Airlines name and brand were officially retired.[31]</p>

<p>Delta Express Boeing 737 in 2001
Comair began services in March 1977 and was headquartered at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. After successfully introducing 50-seat planes into the United States, it was acquired by Delta in October 1999. Comair became the main carrier of Delta Connection and operated over 400 daily flights from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport throughout the U.S., Mexico, and Caribbean. Comair ceased operations on September 29, 2012, and was folded into Delta Connection operations.
Delta Express began service in October 1996 in an attempt by Delta to compete with low cost airlines on leisure-oriented routes. Its main base of operations was Orlando International Airport and it used Boeing 737–200 aircraft. It ceased operations in November 2003 after Song was established.[34]
    Song began service on April 15, 2003 as a single-class airline operated by Delta to compete directly with JetBlue Airways from both airlines' hub at New York–JFK. While the brand was considered a successful addition to the Northeast-to-Florida market, financially the airline suffered.[35] On May 1, 2006, Song was folded into the Delta mainline brand. Song used Boeing 757 aircraft.</p>
            <p>Operations[edit]</p>
 


            <p>Headquarters and offices[edit]</p>
<p>Delta's corporate headquarters is located on a corporate campus on the northern boundary of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, within the city limits of Atlanta.[36][37][38] This location has served as Delta's headquarters since 1941, when the company relocated its corporate offices from Monroe, Louisiana, to Greater Atlanta.[39][40] The crop dusting division of Delta remained headquartered in Monroe until Delta ceased crop dusting in 1966.[41] Prior to 1981, the Delta corporate campus, an 80-acre (32 ha) plot of land in proximity to the old Hartsfield Airport terminal, was outside the City of Atlanta limits in unincorporated Fulton County. On August 3, 1981 the Atlanta City Council approved the annexation of 141 acres (57 ha) of land, an area containing the Delta headquarters. As of 1981 Delta would have had to begin paying $200,000 annually to the City of Atlanta in taxes. In September 1981 the airline sued the city, challenging the annexation on the basis of the constitutionality of the 1960 City of Atlanta annexation of the Hartsfield old terminal.[42] The City of Atlanta was only permitted to annex areas that are adjacent to areas already in the Atlanta city limits.[42]
In addition to hosting Delta's corporate headquarters, Hartsfield-Jackson is also the home of Delta TechOps, the airline's primary maintenance, repair and overhaul arm and the largest full-service airline MRO in North America, specializing in engines, components, airframe and line maintenance.[43]
    Delta maintains a large presence in the Twin Cities, with over 12,000 employees[44] in the region as well as significant corporate support functions housed in the Minneapolis area, including the company's information technology divisional offices.[45]</p>
 


            <p>Branding[edit]</p>
<p>Delta's logo, often called the "widget", was originally unveiled in 1959. Its triangle shape is taken from the Greek letter delta, and recalls the airline's origins in the Mississippi Delta.[46] It is also said to be reminiscent of the swept-wing design of the DC-8, Delta's first jet aircraft.[47]
Delta's current livery is called "Upward & Onward". It features a white fuselage with the company's name in blue lettering, and a widget on the vertical stabilizer. Delta introduced its current livery in 2007 as part of a re-branding after it emerged from bankruptcy. The new livery consists of four colors, while the old one (called "colors in motion") used eight. This meant the switch saved the airline money by removing one day from each aircraft's painting cycle. The airline took four years to repaint all of its aircraft into the current scheme, including aircraft inherited from Northwest Airlines.[46]
Hubs[edit]</p>
            <p>Current hubs[edit]</p>
 


<p>Delta has ten domestic hubs and four international hubs.[17] Delta carries more passengers than any other airline at Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK,[48] New York-LaGuardia,[48] and Salt Lake City.
Amsterdam Airport Schiphol[4] – One of the three European hubs, operated in conjunction with SkyTeam and Joint Venture partner KLM. Delta inherited its alliance with KLM in the merger with Northwest Airlines.
Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris[12] – Delta's second European hub. Operated in conjunction with SkyTeam partner Air France.
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport[49] – Prior to the merger with Northwest Airlines, Cincinnati was the second largest hub for Delta with 670 daily departures. Since the merger, service has been drastically cut, mainly due to its proximity to the Detroit hub, as well as the shutdown of Comair.[50] Service levels have since stabilized and seat capacity has been increasing since late 2015.[51]
Detroit Metropolitan Airport[7] – Acquired through the merger with Northwest, Detroit is Delta's second-largest hub by daily flights and third largest by seats available. It serves as the airline's primary Asian gateway for the northeastern United States.
Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport[5] – In addition to its corporate headquarters, Delta also operates Delta TechOps, Delta's primary maintenance base and the largest airline hub in the world in Atlanta.[52] It is also Delta's main gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean and a secondary transatlantic gateway.
Heathrow Airport, London[53] - Delta's third European hubs, operated in conjunction with Joint Venture partner Virgin Atlantic.
John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City[11] – A major international gateway, especially to Europe. Also offers service on many transcontinental "prestige routes" to west coast destinations including Los Angeles and San Francisco.
LaGuardia Airport, New York City[11] – An important domestic hub created as a result of a slot swap with US Airways. Delta service at LaGuardia covers numerous east coast US cities, and a number of regional destinations in the US and Canada.[54]
Logan International Airport, Boston[55] – A hub for Delta in the second half of the 20th century through the early 2000s. In 2005, Terminal A, was built for Delta's sole use. However, when Delta went bankrupt, they leased 11 of the 22 gates in the terminal. Today, Delta still has a large share in the Boston market, with daily international flights to various cities in Central America, Canada, and major European cities. They now occupy 17 of the 22 gates and have recently opened a second Sky Club.
Los Angeles International Airport[9] – Delta inherited its LAX hub from Western Airlines, but dismantled it in the mid-1990s, opting to relocate most of those aircraft to the U.S. East Coast. Since then, it has re-opened the hub, offering service to Latin America, Asia, and Australia, as well as major domestic bases and West Coast regional destinations. As of May 2015, Delta captured a 17.22% passenger market share with 139 daily departures[56]
Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport[10] – Once the headquarters for Northwest Airlines, Minneapolis is Delta's third largest hub by daily flights and second by seats available. Delta served 25,844,791 passengers at MSP in 2015 and accounts for more than 80% of the airport's traffic. Service includes a number of regional destinations and most major Canadian and American metropolitan areas, as well as select destinations in Latin America, Europe and Asia.
Narita International Airport, Tokyo[15] – Delta's intra-Asia hub, inherited from Northwest. Service allows connections from several of Delta's domestic hubs to other destinations in Asia, including Singapore, Shanghai, and Manila. Several Narita routes have been cut recently, including New York (JFK), Bangkok, and Osaka. This trend, along with the growth of transpacific flights to Asia from the growing Seattle hub has led to speculation that Delta might be downsizing or closing the Narita hub.[57]
Salt Lake City International Airport[13] – Delta's fifth-largest hub, inherited during the 1987 Western Airlines merger. Service from Salt Lake City covers most major US destinations as well as a number of regional destinations in the US and Canada, and select cities in Europe and Hawaii.
Seattle–Tacoma International Airport[14] – Delta announced Seattle's hub status in 2014. The hub serves as an important gateway to Asia. Delta started aggressively building its presence in Seattle in 2011, sparking tension with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines.[58] Delta continues to grow in Seattle, adding more regional and domestic service, as well as new Asian destinations.</p>

            <p>Former hubs[edit]</p>
<p>O'Hare International Airport, Chicago – Delta operated a small hub at O'Hare until the early 1990s.[59]
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport – Delta at one time operated over 200 flights per day from DFW, making it their third-largest hub at the time. Delta closed the hub in February 2005 due to the hub being competitive with American Airlines, which has their main hub there.[60]
Frankfurt Airport – Upon Pan Am's bankruptcy, Delta acquired its Frankfurt hub and the remainder of its Atlantic Division. Delta closed the hub in 1997.[61]
Memphis International Airport – Delta inherited the Memphis hub operation in the Northwest merger. After several rounds of cuts, hub status was removed in 2013.[62]
Orlando International Airport – Delta built up its Orlando hub alongside Comair starting in 1987, going on to become the "Official Airline of Walt Disney World". The airport later became the hub for Delta Express and Song, before Delta pulled back mainline presence in the mid 2000s.[63]
Portland International Airport – Delta built up its Portland hub in the late 1980s to gain a presence in the U.S. to Asia market. The hub operated most of Delta's flights to Asia, but was slowly reduced due to the Japanese and Korean economic recession, and closed in 2001.[64]
Personnel[edit]
Between its mainline operation and subsidiaries, and as of March 2015, Delta employs nearly 80,000 people.[17] Joanne Smith is Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer responsible for the oversight and support of personnel needs at Delta. She was appointed on October 1, 2014 replacing Mike Campbell.[65]
Employee relations[edit]
Delta's 12,000 mainline pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International and are the union's largest pilot group.[66][67] The company's approximately 180 flight dispatchers are represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA).[citation needed]
Not counting the pilots and flight dispatchers, Delta is the only one of the five largest airlines in the United States, and one of only two in the top 9 (the other being JetBlue), whose non-pilot USA domestic staff is entirely non-union.[66]
The non-pilot non-unionization caused issues during and after the merger with Northwest, whose employees had a much higher rate of unionization.[66] While pilots at both airlines were unionized, it was necessary to hold unionization votes for all other groups of employees. Northwest Airlines flight attendants were formerly represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA).[68] A vote on unionization with the AFA at the post-merger Delta was held on 3 November 2010, unionization was narrowly rejected by flight attendants, with 9,544 votes against unionization and 9,216 in favor.[68][69] The AFA accused Delta of interference in the vote and requested the National Mediation Board (NMB) investigate and order a second vote.[66] The NMB investigation found that the election was not compromised and dismissed the claim.[70] Currently both the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and a coalition of the AFA and the Transport Workers Union of America are seeking to hold unionization votes for Delta flight attendants.[71][72][73]</p>

As of March 2015, Delta operates more than 5,400 flights per day. Delta Connection operates 2,533 daily flights.[17]
Delta is the only U.S. carrier that is flying to Accra, Copenhagen, Dakar, Dusseldorf, Johannesburg, Lagos, Moscow, Nice, Prague, Reykjavik, and Stuttgart. It is also the only US carrier that has scheduled service to Africa.</p>
            <p>Alliances and codeshare agreements[edit]</p>
<p>Delta was a founding member of the SkyTeam Alliance in 2000. In addition to SkyTeam partners, Delta Air Lines also has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:[74][75]</p>

<p>Air France–KLM and Alitalia joint venture[edit]</p>
<p>Inherited from the Northwest-KLM relationship (which is older than any of the three major airline alliances including SkyTeam itself), Delta has a transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia. The program coordinates transatlantic operations, including ticket pricing, schedules, capacity, and revenue.[77] On January 27, 2012, the European Commission launched an investigation into the impact of the joint venture on competition on the routes that it covers.[77]
Joint venture with Virgin Atlantic[edit]
            On December 11, 2012, Delta announced that it would spend $360 million to acquire a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic. These shares were previously held by Singapore Airlines. As a part of this agreement, both airlines would share the costs and revenues from all of the joint venture flights the airlines operated. The two airlines planned to operate a total of 31 roundtrip flights between the UK and North America, including nine daily roundtrip flights between London Heathrow and New York City airports (John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport).[78] The two airlines' application for antitrust immunity was granted by the United States Department of Transportation on September 23, 2013.[79]</p>

            <p>Delta Air Lines has the largest Boeing 757 fleet of any airline</p>

<p>As of January 2013, Delta operates a fleet of more than 800 aircraft manufactured by Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas.[17] Delta operates the largest Boeing 717, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, McDonnell Douglas MD-88, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 fleets in the world, and the largest Airbus A330 fleet of any US airline. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft. Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger, and more have since been added.
Unlike other U.S. legacy carriers, Delta often seeks to acquire and utilize older aircraft, especially narrow-bodies, and they have created an extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them. The oldest aircraft in the fleet are the McDonnell Douglas MD-88s, with an average age of over 25 years.[20] However, in early 2011, Delta began talks with Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier to discuss replacing the McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, MD-88s, and older A320 and 757-200 aircraft.[80] On August 22, 2011, Delta placed an order for 100 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft[81] and deferred an order of 100 small narrow-body jets until 2012.[82]
As part of its strategy to utilize less expensive used airplanes, Delta agreed in 2012 to lease 88 Boeing 717s acquired by Southwest Airlines during their acquisition of AirTran Airways.[83] They would be used as replacements for the DC-9 fleet and some 50-seat regional aircraft like the CRJ-100 and -200.[84] The first revenue flight was on October 25, 2013,[85] Delta officially retired its last DC-9 on January 6, 2014; it was used on an as-needed basis until January 22, 2014 when the last one was removed from service.[86][87] Delta was the final US carrier operating the DC-9.[88] As a continuation of the narrowbody fleet refresh and expansion, Delta ordered 75 Bombardier CS100 aircraft and an additional 50 options on April 28, 2016, becoming the first American carrier to order the type.[89]
            The airline has not been as keen to acquire or operate aging widebody aircraft. On August 1, 2014, Delta announced they would begin to retire the aging Boeing 747-400 fleet, acquired as part of the Northwest merger.[90] During a 2014 earnings call, CEO Richard Anderson announced that they would be retired by the end of 2017.[91] On November 20, 2014, the airline announced an order for 25 Airbus A350-900 and 25 Airbus A330-900 aircraft to replace the 747 fleet as it was retired, as well as some aging 767s. A350 deliveries began in the second quarter of 2017, while the first A330-900 is scheduled for 2019.[92][93] </p>

Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport[49] – Prior to the merger with Northwest Airlines, Cincinnati was the second largest hub for Delta with 670 daily departures. Since the merger, service has been drastically cut, mainly due to its proximity to the Detroit hub, as well as the shutdown of Comair.[50] Service levels have since stabilized and seat capacity has been increasing since late 2015.[51]
Detroit Metropolitan Airport[7] – Acquired through the merger with Northwest, Detroit is Delta's second-largest hub by daily flights and third largest by seats available. It serves as the airline's primary Asian gateway for the northeastern United States.
Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport[5] – In addition to its corporate headquarters, Delta also operates Delta TechOps, Delta's primary maintenance base and the largest airline hub in the world in Atlanta.[52] It is also Delta's main gateway to Latin America and the Caribbean and a secondary transatlantic gateway.
Heathrow Airport, London[53] - Delta's third European hubs, operated in conjunction with Joint Venture partner Virgin Atlantic.
John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City[11] – A major international gateway, especially to Europe. Also offers service on many transcontinental "prestige routes" to west coast destinations including Los Angeles and San Francisco.
LaGuardia Airport, New York City[11] – An important domestic hub created as a result of a slot swap with US Airways. Delta service at LaGuardia covers numerous east coast US cities, and a number of regional destinations in the US and Canada.[54]
Logan International Airport, Boston[55] – A hub for Delta in the second half of the 20th century through the early 2000s. In 2005, Terminal A, was built for Delta's sole use. However, when Delta went bankrupt, they leased 11 of the 22 gates in the terminal. Today, Delta still has a large share in the Boston market, with daily international flights to various cities in Central America, Canada, and major European cities. They now occupy 17 of the 22 gates and have recently opened a second Sky Club.
Los Angeles International Airport[9] – Delta inherited its LAX hub from Western Airlines, but dismantled it in the mid-1990s, opting to relocate most of those aircraft to the U.S. East Coast. Since then, it has re-opened the hub, offering service to Latin America, Asia, and Australia, as well as major domestic bases and West Coast regional destinations. As of May 2015, Delta captured a 17.22% passenger market share with 139 daily departures[56]
Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport[10] – Once the headquarters for Northwest Airlines, Minneapolis is Delta's third largest hub by daily flights and second by seats available. Delta served 25,844,791 passengers at MSP in 2015 and accounts for more than 80% of the airport's traffic. Service includes a number of regional destinations and most major Canadian and American metropolitan areas, as well as select destinations in Latin America, Europe and Asia.
Narita International Airport, Tokyo[15] – Delta's intra-Asia hub, inherited from Northwest. Service allows connections from several of Delta's domestic hubs to other destinations in Asia, including Singapore, Shanghai, and Manila. Several Narita routes have been cut recently, including New York (JFK), Bangkok, and Osaka. This trend, along with the growth of transpacific flights to Asia from the growing Seattle hub has led to speculation that Delta might be downsizing or closing the Narita hub.[57]
Salt Lake City International Airport[13] – Delta's fifth-largest hub, inherited during the 1987 Western Airlines merger. Service from Salt Lake City covers most major US destinations as well as a number of regional destinations in the US and Canada, and select cities in Europe and Hawaii.
Seattle–Tacoma International Airport[14] – Delta announced Seattle's hub status in 2014. The hub serves as an important gateway to Asia. Delta started aggressively building its presence in Seattle in 2011, sparking tension with Seattle-based Alaska Airlines.[58] Delta continues to grow in Seattle, adding more regional and domestic service, as well as new Asian destinations.</p>

            </p><p>Former hubs[edit]</p>
<p>O'Hare International Airport, Chicago – Delta operated a small hub at O'Hare until the early 1990s.[59]
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport – Delta at one time operated over 200 flights per day from DFW, making it their third-largest hub at the time. Delta closed the hub in February 2005 due to the hub being competitive with American Airlines, which has their main hub there.[60]
Frankfurt Airport – Upon Pan Am's bankruptcy, Delta acquired its Frankfurt hub and the remainder of its Atlantic Division. Delta closed the hub in 1997.[61]
Memphis International Airport – Delta inherited the Memphis hub operation in the Northwest merger. After several rounds of cuts, hub status was removed in 2013.[62]
Orlando International Airport – Delta built up its Orlando hub alongside Comair starting in 1987, going on to become the "Official Airline of Walt Disney World". The airport later became the hub for Delta Express and Song, before Delta pulled back mainline presence in the mid 2000s.[63]
Portland International Airport – Delta built up its Portland hub in the late 1980s to gain a presence in the U.S. to Asia market. The hub operated most of Delta's flights to Asia, but was slowly reduced due to the Japanese and Korean economic recession, and closed in 2001.[64]
    <p>Personnel[edit]</p>
<p>Between its mainline operation and subsidiaries, and as of March 2015, Delta employs nearly 80,000 people.[17] Joanne Smith is Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer responsible for the oversight and support of personnel needs at Delta. She was appointed on October 1, 2014 replacing Mike Campbell.[65]</p>
    <p>Employee relations[edit]</p>
<p>Delta's 12,000 mainline pilots are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International and are the union's largest pilot group.[66][67] The company's approximately 180 flight dispatchers are represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA).[citation needed]
Not counting the pilots and flight dispatchers, Delta is the only one of the five largest airlines in the United States, and one of only two in the top 9 (the other being JetBlue), whose non-pilot USA domestic staff is entirely non-union.[66]
The non-pilot non-unionization caused issues during and after the merger with Northwest, whose employees had a much higher rate of unionization.[66] While pilots at both airlines were unionized, it was necessary to hold unionization votes for all other groups of employees. Northwest Airlines flight attendants were formerly represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA).[68] A vote on unionization with the AFA at the post-merger Delta was held on 3 November 2010, unionization was narrowly rejected by flight attendants, with 9,544 votes against unionization and 9,216 in favor.[68][69] The AFA accused Delta of interference in the vote and requested the National Mediation Board (NMB) investigate and order a second vote.[66] The NMB investigation found that the election was not compromised and dismissed the claim.[70] Currently both the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and a coalition of the AFA and the Transport Workers Union of America are seeking to hold unionization votes for Delta flight attendants.[71][72][73]</p>

<p>Air France–KLM and Alitalia joint venture[edit]</p>
<p>Inherited from the Northwest-KLM relationship (which is older than any of the three major airline alliances including SkyTeam itself), Delta has a transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia. The program coordinates transatlantic operations, including ticket pricing, schedules, capacity, and revenue.[77] On January 27, 2012, the European Commission launched an investigation into the impact of the joint venture on competition on the routes that it covers.[77]
Joint venture with Virgin Atlantic[edit]
            On December 11, 2012, Delta announced that it would spend $360 million to acquire a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic. These shares were previously held by Singapore Airlines. As a part of this agreement, both airlines would share the costs and revenues from all of the joint venture flights the airlines operated. The two airlines planned to operate a total of 31 roundtrip flights between the UK and North America, including nine daily roundtrip flights between London Heathrow and New York City airports (John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport).[78] The two airlines' application for antitrust immunity was granted by the United States Department of Transportation on September 23, 2013.[79]</p>
           Fleet[edit]</p>
 

 <p>Delta Air Lines has the largest Boeing 757 fleet of any airline
Main article: Delta Air Lines fleet
As of January 2013, Delta operates a fleet of more than 800 aircraft manufactured by Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas.[17] Delta operates the largest Boeing 717, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, McDonnell Douglas MD-88, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 fleets in the world, and the largest Airbus A330 fleet of any US airline. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft. Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger, and more have since been added.
Unlike other U.S. legacy carriers, Delta often seeks to acquire and utilize older aircraft, especially narrow-bodies, and they have created an extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them. The oldest aircraft in the fleet are the McDonnell Douglas MD-88s, with an average age of over 25 years.[20] However, in early 2011, Delta began talks with Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier to discuss replacing the McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, MD-88s, and older A320 and 757-200 aircraft.[80] On August 22, 2011, Delta placed an order for 100 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft[81] and deferred an order of 100 small narrow-body jets until 2012.[82]
As part of its strategy to utilize less expensive used airplanes, Delta agreed in 2012 to lease 88 Boeing 717s acquired by Southwest Airlines during their acquisition of AirTran Airways.[83] They would be used as replacements for the DC-9 fleet and some 50-seat regional aircraft like the CRJ-100 and -200.[84] The first revenue flight was on October 25, 2013,[85] Delta officially retired its last DC-9 on January 6, 2014; it was used on an as-needed basis until January 22, 2014 when the last one was removed from service.[86][87] Delta was the final US carrier operating the DC-9.[88] As a continuation of the narrowbody fleet refresh and expansion, Delta ordered 75 Bombardier CS100 aircraft and an additional 50 options on April 28, 2016, becoming the first American carrier to order the type.[89]
            The airline has not been as keen to acquire or operate aging widebody aircraft. On August 1, 2014, Delta announced they would begin to retire the aging Boeing 747-400 fleet, acquired as part of the Northwest merger.[90] During a 2014 earnings call, CEO Richard Anderson announced that they would be retired by the end of 2017.[91] On November 20, 2014, the airline announced an order for 25 Airbus A350-900 and 25 Airbus A330-900 aircraft to replace the 747 fleet as it was retired, as well as some aging 767s. A350 deliveries began in the second quarter of 2017, while the first A330-900 is scheduled for 2019.[92][93] </p>

[exercise # 5- combines #3 and #4 into one screen]-->Delta Air Lines began as a crop dusting operation called Huff Daland Dusters, Incorporated. The company was founded on May 30, 1924 in Macon, Georgia, and moved to Monroe, Louisiana, in 1925. They flew a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, designed to combat the boll weevil infestation of cotton crops. Collett E. Woolman, one of the original directors, purchased the company on September 13, 1928, and renamed it Delta Air Service. Service began on June 17, 1929 with the inaugural flight between Dallas, Texas and Jackson, Mississippi.[29]
Delta moved its headquarters to its current location in Atlanta in 1941, and continued to grow through the addition of routes and the acquisition of other airlines. They replaced propeller planes with jets in the 1960s and entered international competition to Europe in the 1970s and across the Pacific in the 1980s.
            Delta's more recent history is marked by its emergence from bankruptcy on April 25, 2007, and the subsequent merger with Northwest Airlines. The merger was announced April 14, 2008, and was set to create the world's largest airline. After approval of the merger on October 29, 2008, Northwest continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta until December 31, 2009 when both carriers' operating certificates were merged (the Delta certificate was kept).[30] Delta completed the integration with Northwest on January 31, 2010 when their reservation systems and websites were combined, and the Northwest Airlines name and brand were officially retired.[31]</p>

Delta Air Lines as it exists today is the result of numerous mergers over its history. Predecessor carriers forming the current Delta Air Lines include:
Chicago and Southern Air Lines (formed in 1933, merged into Delta in 1953).[29] Delta flew under the carrier name of Delta-C&S for the following two years.[32]
Northeast Airlines (formed in 1931, merged into Delta in August 1972)[29][33]
Northwest Airlines (formed in 1926, merged into Delta in 2010. Also known as Northwest Orient Airlines from 1950-1986)

<p>Delta Express Boeing 737 in 2001
Comair began services in March 1977 and was headquartered at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. After successfully introducing 50-seat planes into the United States, it was acquired by Delta in October 1999. Comair became the main carrier of Delta Connection and operated over 400 daily flights from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport throughout the U.S., Mexico, and Caribbean. Comair ceased operations on September 29, 2012, and was folded into Delta Connection operations.
Delta Express began service in October 1996 in an attempt by Delta to compete with low cost airlines on leisure-oriented routes. Its main base of operations was Orlando International Airport and it used Boeing 737–200 aircraft. It ceased operations in November 2003 after Song was established.[34]
            Song began service on April 15, 2003 as a single-class airline operated by Delta to compete directly with JetBlue Airways from both airlines' hub at New York–JFK. While the brand was considered a successful addition to the Northeast-to-Florida market, financially the airline suffered.[35] On May 1, 2006, Song was folded into the Delta mainline brand. Song used Boeing 757 aircraft.</p>
 


<p>Headquarters and offices[edit]</p>
<p>Delta's corporate headquarters is located on a corporate campus on the northern boundary of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, within the city limits of Atlanta.[36][37][38] This location has served as Delta's headquarters since 1941, when the company relocated its corporate offices from Monroe, Louisiana, to Greater Atlanta.[39][40] The crop dusting division of Delta remained headquartered in Monroe until Delta ceased crop dusting in 1966.[41] Prior to 1981, the Delta corporate campus, an 80-acre (32 ha) plot of land in proximity to the old Hartsfield Airport terminal, was outside the City of Atlanta limits in unincorporated Fulton County. On August 3, 1981 the Atlanta City Council approved the annexation of 141 acres (57 ha) of land, an area containing the Delta headquarters. As of 1981 Delta would have had to begin paying $200,000 annually to the City of Atlanta in taxes. In September 1981 the airline sued the city, challenging the annexation on the basis of the constitutionality of the 1960 City of Atlanta annexation of the Hartsfield old terminal.[42] The City of Atlanta was only permitted to annex areas that are adjacent to areas already in the Atlanta city limits.[42]
In addition to hosting Delta's corporate headquarters, Hartsfield-Jackson is also the home of Delta TechOps, the airline's primary maintenance, repair and overhaul arm and the largest full-service airline MRO in North America, specializing in engines, components, airframe and line maintenance.[43]
            Delta maintains a large presence in the Twin Cities, with over 12,000 employees[44] in the region as well as significant corporate support functions housed in the Minneapolis area, including the company's information technology divisional offices.[45]</p>
 


           <p> Branding[edit]</p>
<p>Delta's logo, often called the "widget", was originally unveiled in 1959. Its triangle shape is taken from the Greek letter delta, and recalls the airline's origins in the Mississippi Delta.[46] It is also said to be reminiscent of the swept-wing design of the DC-8, Delta's first jet aircraft.[47]
            Delta's current livery is called "Upward & Onward". It features a white fuselage with the company's name in blue lettering, and a widget on the vertical stabilizer. Delta introduced its current livery in 2007 as part of a re-branding after it emerged from bankruptcy. The new livery consists of four colors, while the old one (called "colors in motion") used eight. This meant the switch saved the airline money by removing one day from each aircraft's painting cycle. The airline took four years to repaint all of its aircraft into the current scheme, including aircraft inherited from Northwest Airlines.[46]</p>
Hubs[edit]
        <p>Current hubs[edit]</p>
 

<p>
Delta has ten domestic hubs and four international hubs.[17] Delta carries more passengers than any other airline at Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK,[48] New York-LaGuardia,[48] and Salt Lake City.

The program coordinates transatlantic operations, including ticket pricing, schedules, capacity, and revenue.[77] On January 27, 2012, the European Commission launched an investigation into the impact of the joint venture on competition on the routes that it covers.[77]
Joint venture with Virgin Atlantic[edit]
            On December 11, 2012, Delta announced that it would spend $360 million to acquire a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic. These shares were previously held by Singapore Airlines. As a part of this agreement, both airlines would share the costs and revenues from all of the joint venture flights the airlines operated. The two airlines planned to operate a total of 31 roundtrip flights between the UK and North America, including nine daily roundtrip flights between London Heathrow and New York City airports (John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport).[78] The two airlines' application for antitrust immunity was granted by the United States Department of Transportation on September 23, 2013.[79]</p>

 <p>Delta Air Lines has the largest Boeing 757 fleet of any airline
Main article: Delta Air Lines fleet
As of January 2013, Delta operates a fleet of more than 800 aircraft manufactured by Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas.[17] Delta operates the largest Boeing 717, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, McDonnell Douglas MD-88, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 fleets in the world, and the largest Airbus A330 fleet of any US airline. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft. Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger, and more have since been added.
Unlike other U.S. legacy carriers, Delta often seeks to acquire and utilize older aircraft, especially narrow-bodies, and they have created an extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them. The oldest aircraft in the fleet are the McDonnell Douglas MD-88s, with an average age of over 25 years.[20] However, in early 2011, Delta began talks with Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier to discuss replacing the McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, MD-88s, and older A320 and 757-200 aircraft.[80] On August 22, 2011, Delta placed an order for 100 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft[81] and deferred an order of 100 small narrow-body jets until 2012.[82]
As part of its strategy to utilize less expensive used airplanes, Delta agreed in 2012 to lease 88 Boeing 717s acquired by Southwest Airlines during their acquisition of AirTran Airways.[83] They would be used as replacements for the DC-9 fleet and some 50-seat regional aircraft like the CRJ-100 and -200.[84] The first revenue flight was on October 25, 2013,[85] Delta officially retired its last DC-9 on January 6, 2014; it was used on an as-needed basis until January 22, 2014 when the last one was removed from service.[86][87] Delta was the final US carrier operating the DC-9.[88] As a continuation of the narrowbody fleet refresh and expansion, Delta ordered 75 Bombardier CS100 aircraft and an additional 50 options on April 28, 2016, becoming the first American carrier to order the type.[89]
            The airline has not been as keen to acquire or operate aging widebody aircraft. On August 1, 2014, Delta announced they would begin to retire the aging Boeing 747-400 fleet, acquired as part of the Northwest merger.[90] During a 2014 earnings call, CEO Richard Anderson announced that they would be retired by the end of 2017.[91] On November 20, 2014, the airline announced an order for 25 Airbus A350-900 and 25 Airbus A330-900 aircraft to replace the 747 fleet as it was retired, as well as some aging 767s. A350 deliveries began in the second quarter of 2017, while the first A330-900 is scheduled for 2019.[92][93] </p>
